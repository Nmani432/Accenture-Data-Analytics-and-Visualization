# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization

🧠 Overview
This project is part of the Accenture North America Virtual Experience Program on Forage. It simulates a real-world business problem involving data analysis and visualization to generate actionable insights for a media company.

🎯 Objective
To identify the Top 5 content categories with the highest popularity based on user reactions and engagement scores. The insights help the client understand which categories resonate most with their audience.

📁 Data Sources
The project utilizes 7 datasets shared by the client, but only the following 3 were found relevant:

Content.csv – Metadata for each content piece (ID, category, content type, etc.)
Reactions.csv – User reactions data (content ID, reaction type, timestamp, etc.)
ReactionTypes.csv – Score and details for each reaction type
These datasets were linked using a data model.

Analyzed the data model to determine the required datasets
Selected Content, Reactions, and ReactionTypes as necessary for the analysis
Identified how popularity is measured using reaction score
As part of this task, I completed a knowledge check quiz to confirm my understanding of the datasets and business requirements before proceeding to analysis.

🧹 Task 2: Data Cleaning and Modelling
Cleaned all 3 datasets by:
Removing missing values
Changing incorrect data types
Dropping irrelevant columns
Merged datasets using:
Content ID and Reaction Type
